# PRODUCT-STOCK-CRUD-MANAGER
This project is a command-line application developed in Python designed to efficiently manage product inventory using the fundamental Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. The manager provides a robust system for keeping track of all items in stock, including essential details such as the Product Name, Stock Keeping Unit (SKU), Quantity in Stock, and Unit Price. Data persistence is achieved by storing all product records in a structured manner, typically using a SQLite database or a persistent file format like JSON or CSV, ensuring that inventory changes are saved between sessions. The core functionality includes the ability to add new products to the catalog, view the complete inventory or search for specific items by SKU, update stock levels following sales or restock events, and delete product records when items are discontinued. This project serves as a practical demonstration of handling data structures, interacting with a database/file system, and implementing clean, modular code through a menu-driven interface.
